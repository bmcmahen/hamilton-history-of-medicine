Explore the history of medicine in Hamilton, Ontario.

This website uses Hapi, React, React-Router, and Redux to perform both server-side and clientside rendering. Webpack is used to bundle both client and server code. This is still a major WIP, and I haven't fully configured the production build yet (i.e., extracting css).

```
$ npm install
$ gulp run
```

To run the project you'll need to include your own `config.js` file in `server/config.js`.
